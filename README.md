# mAIChain
mAIChain is an implementation of an AI chain as a microservice. It acts as a coordination agent in a collection of AI agents that perform specific tasks. It has no hardware constraints and can run on machines that also run other agents. There can be more than one mAIChain per collection of agents. It defines a specific goal when dealing with multiple agents.
