# mAI
An implementation of an AI chain as a microservice. mAI acts as a coordination agent in a collection of AI agents that perform specific tasks. mAI has no hardware constraints and can run on machines that also run other agents. There can be more than one mAI per collection of agents; mAI defines a specific goal when dealing with multiple agents.
